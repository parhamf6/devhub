## 🛠️ Setup & Development

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devhub.git
cd devhub
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

App will be running at: `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🎨 Theming

DevHub uses a custom OKLCH-based theme system defined with CSS variables for:

```css
--primary
--primary-foreground
--accent
--accent-foreground
--muted
--muted-foreground
```

Switch between dark/light using the ThemeToggle component. Extend or override via `tailwind.config.ts`.

## 🧪 Adding a New Tool

To add a new tool:

1. Create a new file under `lib/tools/`:

```ts
// lib/tools/uuid-generator.ts
export const uuidGenerator = {
  slug: "uuid-generator",
  name: "UUID Generator",
  category: "Utilities",
  description: "Generate UUIDs quickly",
  inputs: [],
  run: () => crypto.randomUUID(),
}
```

2. The tool will be auto-registered and accessible at:
   `/dashboard/tools/uuid-generator`

---

## 🧠 Writing Learn Content

1. Add a new MDX file to `content/learn/`:

```mdx
---
title: "What is a UUID?"
description: "Understanding UUIDs and how they work."
tags: ["uuid", "tools"]
category: "Guides"
---

# What is a UUID?

A UUID is a universally unique identifier...
```

2. It will be rendered with TOC, theming, and accessible via the Learn sidebar.

---

## 📤 Deployment

You can deploy using any platform that supports Next.js:

* **Vercel** (recommended)
* **Netlify**
* **Custom VPS with Docker**

Example for Vercel:

```bash
