## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Enter Password**: Type or paste your password
2. **View Analysis**: See instant strength feedback
3. **Check Details**: Review entropy and complexity
4. **Get Suggestions**: View improvement recommendations
5. **Generate Strong**: Use generator for secure passwords

> 💡 Tip: Use the password generator to create strong, random passwords that meet security requirements.

## ⚙️ Strength Levels

| Level | Score | Description | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Very Weak | 0-20 | High risk | Immediate change needed |
| Weak | 21-40 | Insufficient | Significant improvement needed |
| Medium | 41-60 | Basic security | Consider strengthening |
| Strong | 61-80 | Good security | Acceptable for most uses |
| Very Strong | 81-100 | Excellent | Ideal for sensitive accounts |

## 🛠️ Analysis Criteria

- 📏 Length (min 12 characters)
- 🔤 Character types:
  - Lowercase letters
  - Uppercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- 🎲 Entropy calculation
- ⚠️ Common password check
- 🔍 Data breach verification
- ⏱️ Crack time estimation

---

## 🧪 Examples

### ✅ Strong Password Example

```
Characteristics:
- Length: 16+ characters
- Mixed case letters
- Numbers and symbols
- High entropy
- Not in common list
- No breach history
```

### ❌ Weak Password Example

```
Issues:
- Short length
- Single case
- No numbers/symbols
- Low entropy
- Common pattern
- Possible breach
```

---

## 🔐 Security Metrics

### Entropy Calculation
```
Entropy = Length × log2(Pool Size)
Pool Size = Number of possible characters
Higher entropy = Stronger password
```

### Crack Time Estimation
- < 30 bits: Instantly
- 30-50 bits: Minutes to hours
- 50-70 bits: Days to months
- 70-90 bits: Years
- 90+ bits: Centuries

## 📊 Best Practices

1. **Length Requirements**
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Prefer 16+ for sensitive accounts
   - Balance security vs usability

2. **Character Composition**
   - Mix different character types
   - Avoid predictable patterns
   - Use unique combinations

3. **Password Selection**
   - Avoid personal information
   - Don't reuse passwords
   - Consider passphrases
   - Use password manager

4. **Regular Updates**
   - Change compromised passwords
   - Periodic security reviews
   - Monitor breach notifications
