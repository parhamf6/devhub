### üìò Learn: Hash Text Generator

#### üîç What is Hashing?

Hashing is the process of converting any input (text or file) into a fixed-length string of characters, typically for **data integrity**, **security**, or **fingerprinting**. The result is called a **hash** or **digest**. Hashing is **one-way**‚Äîyou can generate a hash from input, but you cannot reverse it to get the original input.

#### üõ†Ô∏è How This Tool Helps

This tool allows you to:

* Hash text or uploaded files using popular algorithms like `MD5`, `SHA-1`, `SHA-256`, and more.
* Hash using multiple algorithms at once.
* Copy or download results instantly.
* Toggle between plaintext and Base64 or HEX input modes.
* Compare hashes and test for collisions.

### üîê Common Use Cases

| Use Case                       | Example                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Password hashing (with salt)\* | `SHA-256("mypassword123 + salt")`       |
| File integrity checks          | Check if downloaded file was tampered   |
| API request signatures (HMAC)  | Authenticate messages with a secret key |
| Unique content fingerprints    | Detect changes in content or assets     |
| Blockchain/data structures     | Hash blocks or transactions             |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: For password storage, **NEVER** use raw hashes like MD5 or SHA-1. Use algorithms like `bcrypt`, `scrypt`, or `argon2` with proper salting.*

### üß† How It Works

#### 1. **Text Input / File Upload**

* Paste any text or upload a file.
* The tool reads the input as UTF-8 by default.
* For files, the entire file is read and hashed.

#### 2. **Select Algorithm(s)**

Choose one or more algorithms:

* **MD5** ‚Äì Fast but insecure, use only for quick non-secure checks.
* **SHA-1** ‚Äì Broken, no longer recommended for security.
* **SHA-256** ‚Äì Modern and secure, widely used.
* **SHA-512** ‚Äì Longer, more secure version of SHA-2.
* **Other algorithms** may be available depending on platform/browser support.

#### 3. **Generate & View**

* Click ‚ÄúGenerate‚Äù or enable Auto Mode.
* Copy, download, or explore the result.
* You can view hash length and encoding options.

### üß™ Examples

```text
Input: "devhub"
MD5:     8607a5cc1f1f6f3772fa8e82d712264e
SHA-1:   13f7f0fcde99e02cfd45726adce9a6d8f15ed3b5
SHA-256: 57f184bffdfc8e62523e598e0739c13d9e680fe4078e9dc9b7bbf94b9ed78633
```

```text
Input: [Upload file: "design.png"]
SHA-256: 4a1b8c3f11... (used to verify integrity)
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features (optional)

* **Hash Multiple Algorithms:** Get several hashes at once.
* **File Hashing:** Drag-and-drop or upload any file.
* **HMAC Mode:** Add a secret key for authenticated hashes.
* **Salt Option:** Combine input with a user-defined salt.
* **Compare Hashes:** Paste two hash values to check equality.
* **Output Options:** Toggle lowercase/uppercase, with/without spacing.
* **Encoding Input:** Convert Base64 or Hex input before hashing.

### üß∑ Security Tips

* Avoid using insecure hashes like MD5 or SHA-1 for critical tasks.
* For password hashing, never use this tool in production‚Äîuse `bcrypt` or `argon2` with salting and peppering.
* Hashes are deterministic‚Äîsame input always gives the same output.
* A tiny change in input produces a totally different hash (avalanche effect).
