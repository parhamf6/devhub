## ⚙️ Cron Field Reference

| Field         | Range      | Examples         | Description                |
|---------------|------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Minute        | 0-59       | `0`, `*/5`, `15` | Minute of the hour         |
| Hour          | 0-23       | `0`, `12`, `*/2` | Hour of the day            |
| Day of Month  | 1-31       | `*`, `1,15`, `10-20` | Day of the month      |
| Month         | 1-12       | `*`, `1`, `6,12` | Month of the year          |
| Day of Week   | 0-7        | `*`, `1`, `0,6`  | Day of the week (0/7=Sun)  |

**Special Patterns:**
- `*` – Every value
- `*/N` – Every N units
- `A,B,C` – Specific values
- `A-B` – Range

## 🛠️ Analysis Criteria

- 📝 Syntax validation
- 📅 Human-readable schedule
- ⏱️ Next run time simulation
- ⚠️ Error feedback for invalid expressions
- 🔍 Field-by-field guides and examples

## 🧪 Examples

### ✅ Common Cron Expressions

```
0 0 * * *        # Every day at midnight
*/15 * * * *     # Every 15 minutes
0 9 * * 1-5      # 9 AM, Monday to Friday
0 0 1 * *        # First day of every month at midnight
```

### ❌ Invalid Examples

```
60 24 * * *      # Minute and hour out of range
* * * 13 *       # Month out of range
* * * * 8        # Day of week out of range
```

## 🔎 Human-Readable Output

- **"Every day at midnight"**
- **"Every 15 minutes"**
- **"At 9:00 AM, Monday through Friday"**
- **"At midnight on the first day of every month"**

## 📅 Next Run Times

Simulate upcoming execution times for any valid cron expression. Useful for testing and debugging schedules.

---

## 📊 Best Practices

1. **Avoid Overlapping Jobs**
   - Ensure previous runs finish before next starts.
2. **Use Specific Times**
   - Avoid scheduling all jobs on the hour.
3. **Consider System Load**
   - Schedule heavy tasks during off-peak hours.
4. **Log and Monitor**
   - Implement logging for all scheduled jobs.
5. **Document Complex Expressions**
   - Add comments or use human-readable descriptions.
